# This project is to design a computer architecture from discrete NAND logic up to a fully operating computing architecture.


## Why?

Because designing an entire computing architecture from scratch is fun and edumacational! 
It gives us an opportunity, among other things, to learn, practice and use:

 * Verilog / Hardware synthesis
 * FPGA usage (when we get to the actual real world build)
 * Advanced digital logic concepts
 * Writing and building emulators

Also, how many people can say they've designed an entire computing architecture from scratch?
Just watch the ladies flock in when you start throwing _that_ one around at parties!

## Tools being used

 * Hardware will initially be developed in software using Verilog using [Icarus Verilog][1] as a simulator.
 * Tasks for automating compilation and everything else are all done using [Rake/Ruby][2].
